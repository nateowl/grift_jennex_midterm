		<p> Being early for events is important because it provides a buffer time, it allows you to be prepared for the event, and it helps the people who are organizing the event when everyone doesn’t show up right when it starts at the same time. Being early is a way to make sure you’re not late, it also shows respect to the people by being ready when they are.  I think that being early for occasions is a really good way to provide buffer time and also gives respect people.  I always am early for events and occasions because I don’t want to be late if traffic is bad, if it takes me longer to leave, if I can’t find the place, and if I arrive early, I am ready whenever other people are ready.  Being late not only shows disrespect because you didn’t come when expected but also depending on the event makes the people wait around.  Why should the people at the event wait, when instead you can wait for a bit less time than they would be and be ready when they are?  Being exactly on time is somewhat reasonable but how can you be certain that nothing is going to go wrong and you’re going to be exactly on time.  There are so many variables in which you could be later than expected so planning to be exactly on time is an unnecessary risk.  Being early for events is a great idea because it provides a buffer, is respectful, and is the smartest option. </p>

		<p>In conclusion we both have different opinions on whether being late or early is important.  Overall it doesn't really matter but rather its more important to have a routine that is set and works for you. </p>
