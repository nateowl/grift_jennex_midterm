		<p>Do you know what the worst feeling in the world is? Waiting. We’ve all been there, the “hour long wait in the reception room”, the “where’s our food at? It should have been here like 15 minutes ago?.” It sucks, you feel helpless as your doomed to just twiddle your thumbs until whatever you’re waiting for happens. So my question is this: why would you intentionally put yourself in a position where you have to wait on others? That is exactly what people who chose to be early (also known as a “morning person”) are doing. It makes absolutely no sense to me, why would you want to intentionally leave the comfort of your own home just to sit/stand around on your phone for half an hour? In my eyes, the closer you can get to being exactly on time, the better. Some people may argue that its poor form or manners to arrive just as something starts, but surely if you’re supposed to be there at 9:00, getting there at 9:00:30 shows excellent time management skills? I'd even go as far as saying it’s beneficial to be late it certain situations, especially social. For example, I always like to show up “fashionably late” to birthday parties. Why? Because they don’t bring out the food until most people have arrived. The person who came early, has been sitting for almost an hour now, has had to put up with a bunch of boring introductions and is probably starving. Me? I just showed up, greeted by a piece of pizza and a slice of cake, the party is well underway so I just go find my established group of friends and hang with them. So my final point is this, who would you rather be?
